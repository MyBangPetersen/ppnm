EXAM-PROJECT NUMBER 28

As in chapter 4.3 of the book, we want to diagonalize a matrix A of the form

A = D + W

where D is a diagonal matrix and W is an update-matrix. 
This can be done with symmetric row/column updates, which is a
kind of rank-2 updates. This can be done with an update matrix as
in equation (4.18). 

The eiganvalues for the system is found by the methods descriped in subsection
4.3.2 and solved by using Newtons method, as it runs with O(nÂ²) operations. 

My solution contains what I think corresponds to a little more than part a, and some of part b 
(7-8 points of a normal homework) as the script runs and is able to find the matrix A and
then the eigenvalues of the system, given the matrix D, vector u and the inteeger p.
