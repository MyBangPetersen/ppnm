EXAM-PROJECT NUMBER 28

As in chapter 4.3 of the book, we want to diagonalize a matrix A of the form

A = D + W

where D is a diagonal matrix and W is an update-matrix. 
This can be done with symmetric row/column updates, which is a
kind of rank-2 updates. This can be done with an update matrix as
in equation (4.18). 

The eiganvalues for the system is found by the methods descriped in subsection
4.3.2, where
